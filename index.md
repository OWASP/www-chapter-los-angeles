Welcome to the OWASP
[LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles) Chapter home page.

> **Note:** Some community members search for OWASP LA as “OWASPLA” (all one word). Don’t worry — you’re in the right place!

<!-- Including "owaspla" here helps search engines recognize it as an alternate spelling of OWASP LA -->

The OWASP Los Angeles chapter typically meets on the 4th Wednesday every month (except Nov) for dinner. We have a great security-related speaker on an appsec related topic. Join us for a great opportunity to network before and following the talk, while enjoying amazing local food and drinks.
