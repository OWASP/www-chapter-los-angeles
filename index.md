Welcome to the OWASP
[LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles) Chapter home page.

The OWASP Los Angeles chapter typically meets on the 4th Wednesday every month for dinner, a great security-related speaker and great networking. We frequently go out for post-talk drinks to socialize and understand what security is really about. Join the movement today!
