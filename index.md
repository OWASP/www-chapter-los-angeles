Welcome to the OWASP
[LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles) Chapter home page.

> **Note:** Some community members search for OWASP LA as “OWASPLA” (all one word). Don’t worry — you’re in the right place!

<!-- Including "owaspla" here helps search engines recognize it as an alternate spelling of OWASP LA -->
